# Sorting
## Bubble sort

A simple comparison sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list to be sorted, compares each pair of adjacent items and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. Passes through the list are repeated until no swaps are needed.

## Insertion sort

Insertion sort is a simple in-place comparison sorting algorithm that works the way people usually sort playing cards in their hands. It works by taking elements from the list one by one and inserting them in their correct position into the sorted sub-list. Insertion realized by shifting in the present implementation.
