# Factorials

Algorithms compute the factorial for a given number [recursively](/math/factorial_recur.cpp) and using [for loop](/math/factorial_loop.cpp) by definition of a factorial. Unsigned long long value was used to store the factorial (max 20!)

# Prime factorization
Simple prime decomposition [algorithm](/math/factorize.cpp) by trial division with Sieve of Eratosthenes.

# Fibonacci number

Recurrent [algorithm](/math/fibonacci_rec.cpp) to calculate the N-th Fibonacci number without saving of already computed numbers (very unefficient algorithm with complexity: Ðž(phi^n), where phi = 1.618... - the golden ratio) and with saving (O(n)).
