## [Factorials](/math/factorial_recur.cpp)

Algorithms compute the factorial for a given number [recursively](/math/factorial_recur.cpp) and using [for loop](/math/factorial_loop.cpp) by definition of a factorial. Unsigned long long value was used to store the factorial (max 20!)

## [Prime factorization](/math/factorize.cpp)
Simple prime decomposition algorithm by trial division with Sieve of Eratosthenes.

## [Fibonacci number](/math/fibonacci_rec.cpp)

Recurrent algorithm to calculate the N-th Fibonacci number without saving of already computed numbers (very unefficient algorithm with complexity: Ðž(phi^n), where phi = 1.618... - the golden ratio) and with saving (O(n)).

# [Euclid's GCD Algorithm](/math/euclid_GCD.cpp)

The Euclid's algorithm is an efficient method for computing the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers. The Euclidean algorithm is based on the principle that the greatest common divisor of two numbers does not change if the larger number is replaced by its difference with the smaller number.

Computational complexity: O(log min(a, b))
